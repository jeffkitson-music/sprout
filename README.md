A remix of [seedpart](https://github.com/MJL85/seedpart) (BIP39 Seed Split Tool)

## :warning: WARNING
**DO NOT USE THIS** on any device that is connected to the internet or will ever be connected to the internet ever again (full airgap). If you do not fully airgap, you risk exposing your seed phrase. This is is a hobby project to better understand and work with seed splitting. It is not intended for actual use.

## :eyes: About
This is a remix implementation of [seedpart](https://github.com/MJL85/seedpart), a seed-splitting tool for BIP39 keys. 

What it does:
- Splits a BIP39 seed-phrase into three fresh seed phrases (called "shards" or "keys") that don't reveal the original phrase.
- Reconstructs the original seed with two of the three shards

It is **critically important** that you know what you're doing before implementing this strategy. If not done correctly either in splitting or reconstructing your seed phrase, it is possible to expose your seed phrase or lose it entirely. See warning.
